## Dear Neighbors

### We’re all in this together, we’ll get through it together too.

#### *Dear Neighbors* is a project from Code for Denver, intended to be printed out and hung in physical spaces (elevators, lobbies, lampposts, etc.) as a way that you can identify yourself and others as helpers for your at-risk neighbors during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

#### Print the file, fill in your contact information, leave room for others to do the same, and hang up in places those in need might still see it.
